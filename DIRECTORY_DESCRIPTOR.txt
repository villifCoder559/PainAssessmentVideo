## ATTENTION
I applied the following changes:
  - A `pretrained/` folder has been added to store the pretrained VideoMAEv2 model.
  - The `forward_features` function in `VideoMAEv2/models/modeling_finetune.py` has been modified:
  - Added `return_embedding=False` at line 429.
  - Added lines 444-445 to obtain the embedding before the classification process.
